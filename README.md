# Get Catchable, an Angular and Springboot project

## A fully fonctionnal website, that helps to find bugs and fishes (in ACNH) using filters

This project is a website that helps me to find catchable species in a game called **Animal Crossing New Horizon**.
In this game, catchable spawn on a certain month and within a specific time frame. Forcing me to check manually what can I 
find when connecting. In order not to waste my time doing that, I imagined this website (wasn't the first one to
think about it tbh). Here are the different steps to build my project : 

* thinking about the conception of this website, using a tool called looping (similar to diagrams.net).
* create the database using **PostgreSQL**
* create the backend with **Springboot** 
* create the frontend with **Angular**
